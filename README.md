## About Husky Zoom

The theme of this year's Hackathon was sustainability. Our team focused on the topic of transportation and designed a bike share service for UConn and its surrounding communities. With 800 available bikes, Husky Zoom offers an environmentally friendly, accessible way for students, professors, and residents to travel around the area. Cars implant a huge carbon footprint on this planet, and bike sharing will encourage people to skip the car, reduce traffic on the road, lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and get some exercise while having fun!
